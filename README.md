# Mug & Door Object Recognition with Keras Model

This project uses a **Keras model** to recognize objects in images, specifically:
- **Mug**
- ![Mug Example](Mug img.png)
- **Door**
- ![Door Example](door img.png)



The model is loaded in Python, processes the image, and predicts the object with confidence score.
